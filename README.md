# AM transmitter prototype

Hacked together a simple AM transmitter using TL072 op-amp and a few transistors.
Works, barely.
Control the frequency by changing potentiometer values, oscillates fine up to 500-700kHz.
LC resonance circuit is tuned to 1Mhz, swapping out L1 to 1mH drops it down to 500k, seems to work better that way.
